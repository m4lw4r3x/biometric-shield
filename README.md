# Biometric-Shield 🛡️

> Reclaim your face. Reclaim your freedom.

**Biometric Shield** is a modular, open-source toolkit that helps individuals, activists, and communities defend against biometric surveillance — including facial recognition, gait tracking, and iris/fingerprint scans.

### 🌐 Why?

We’re in a biometric gold rush. Governments and corporations are harvesting and analyzing our most personal data — our bodies. This project aims to build **practical defenses** and **educational tools** to put privacy back in the hands of the people.

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ **Face Masking**: Detect and blur/mask faces using open models.
- 🎭 **Adversarial Patches**: Generate wearable patches to fool surveillance systems.
- 🔐 **On-device Biometric Storage**: Encrypt and store sensitive biometric data locally.
