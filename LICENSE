## ðŸ§  Tool Ideas (Modules You Can Build)

| Module Name                    | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `biometric_masker.py`         | Use OpenCV or DLib to detect and blur faces, eyes, or bodies in photos and videos. |
| `adversarial_patch_generator.py` | Train a small CNN to generate wearable image patterns (CV Dazzle-inspired). |
| `local_biometric_vault.py`    | AES-256 encrypted biometric locker (no cloud upload). |
| `cli/shield_cli.py`           | Terminal-based tool for batch image/video processing. |
| `face_obfuscator_web.py`      | Optional web UI built with Gradio or Streamlit. |
| `mobile_shield_launcher/`     | Placeholder for Android/iOS wrapper that uses on-device TensorFlow Lite. |
